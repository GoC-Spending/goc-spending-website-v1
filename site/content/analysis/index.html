<h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>

<p>The charts below are simple aggregate analyses of Government of Canada contract spending data. They are generated from the <a href="/data">combined dataset</a> of scraped Proactive Disclosure websites and Open Government CSV data. See the <a href="/methodology">Methodology</a> page to learn more about how this data was aggregated and analyzed.</p>

<p>Because the spending data represented here was normalized year-by-year (to the closest calendar year), given the <a href="/methodology#limitations">limitations of the source data</a>, the numbers below should be considered as estimated rather than actual values. Total spending amounts on a per-company and per-year basis are not published at a government-wide level by the Government of Canada.</p>

<p>This is a volunteer-led effort, and no guarantees are made for the accuracy of the data or the processes used to aggregate and analyze it. You can <a href="/data">download the full dataset</a> yourself to conduct more advanced analyses of it.</p>
