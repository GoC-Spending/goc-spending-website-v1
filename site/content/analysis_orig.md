# Analysis

The charts below are simple aggregate analyses of Government of Canada contract spending data. They are generated from the [combined dataset](/data) of scraped Proactive Disclosure websites and Open Government CSV data. See the [Methodology](/methodology) page to learn more about how this data was aggregated and analyzed.

Because the spending data represented here was normalized year-by-year (to the closest calendar year), given the [limitations of the source data](/methodology#limitations), the numbers below should be considered as estimated rather than actual values. Total spending amounts on a per-company and per-year basis are not published at a government-wide level by the Government of Canada.

This is a volunteer-led effort, and no guarantees are made for the accuracy of the data or the processes used to aggregate and analyze it. You can [download the full dataset](/data) yourself to conduct more advanced analyses of it.
